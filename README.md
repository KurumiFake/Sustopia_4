# Sustopia

A sussy server software that you shouldnt use (the first rel is production ready tho cuz i only removed stuff and bump log4j)

**NOTE: This is a 1.16.5 fork. For newer versions, check out [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/pufferfish) (not made by me, good and stable)**

## Building the fork

```bash
./gradlew applyPatches
./gradlew paperclip
# or on windows
gradle.bat applyPatches
gradle.bat paperclip
```

This will output your distributable JAR at `sustopia-paperclip.jar`, right in your main directory.
