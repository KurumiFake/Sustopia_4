# Sustopia

A sussy 1.16.5 [Airplane](https://airplane.gg) fork aimed at higher performance and security while still relatively stable.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew applyPatches && ./gradlew build && ./gradlew paperclip
# or on windows
gradle.bat applyPatches && gradle.bat build && gradle.bat paperclip
```

This will output a distributable JAR at `sustopia-paperclip.jar`, right in your main directory.
